April 15, 2022

I spent the last year making changes to everything in order to focus more time on coding. I tried #100DaysofCode a few times, but couldn't complete it due to work obligations. Now things have finally slowed down enough that I am able to code daily, plus I will be back in school in the fall which will allow me more time to code. 
Today I'm mostly getting organized, but my hour of code will be using the ZTM Dev course to refresh and ease my way back into coding all the time. My schedule only lists Sections 1-5, but I'm hoping to get a bit farther along to start working on the first project. I'll update this at the end of the day, but I'm going to start filling up my Github with projects for a change. 

PM Update: Determined to actually complete every course I've purchased, I started with the beginning ZTM Dev course and completed the HTML sections (1-5). I also worked on my personal site (returning to it after this message) and updated all of my coding sites, contacts, and repository locations. All in all it was closer to 5 hours of code related time, 2.5 recorded on my WakaTime, and I turned tracking off for the remainder because they were related to work and not my personal coding time. 

ZTM covered HTML for these sections and I was familiar with all of it, so I won't comment about it much. I'm sure it would have been helpful when I first learned HTML, but I'm curious to see if the later content will redirect to W3 as often as the first sections did. W3 is a great reference, but I'm looking into supplemental material for the content that is new to me as I don't like to skim over details.

I continued working on the HTML for the website layout. I coded for over 2 hours and it's mostly been coding the layout and making design choices for the html/css. I've been copying some of the parts of a previous website design that I used in wordpress and building it myself.

Today was a holiday, so I got a later start than usual. I did manage to code for 1 hour and 31 minutes, but my WakaTime didn't pick it up for some reason. Fortunately Click Up worked as my backup. I did a quick HTML refresher on W3, worked on the code for a news ticker, added some code for featured images/articles, and added a section to my site.
