December 1, 2021

I started this challenge previously, but my approach wasn't effective and the global changes over the past two years drastically changed my circumstances. Here's one reason why I derailed and how I'm fixing it:

1. Time Management and Responsibility Changes
My children and I are working/ going to school virtually, so the school timetable has dictated my schedule. This wouldn't have been an issue, but it changed multiple times. Each time I put a routine in place, I'd have a surprise day when I had to leave my computer to contact the school, internet provider, health unit, etc. I started to work later, code later, sleep less, and I couldn't get everything accomplished. I had stacked my work schedule with my home schedule, then added others. I had to make learning and working from home a priority and I was able to stay home completely as of October 2021. Part of my issue was timing, but most of it was my mistake of trying to accomodate everyone else's timetables. I needed to find a better way.

I also had 3 years of University education in Instrumentation and Control Technology that I planned to finish and convert to a CS degree at this time. I couldn't continue my original degree in this area, had repeatedly compromised, and eventually found myself waitlisted. Deciding to learn code on my own while I wait, I took courses from Coursera, ZTM, Udemy, FreeCodeCamp, W3C, and started filling in some of the knowledge gaps. I'm not quite at the beginning, and I don't have a lot of experience with full coding. I learned HTML and CSS initially so I could decorate a MySpace page, so I had a lot to catch up on. As a result, I have knowledge gaps and many things like SEO, canoncial tags, etc. were only being used for marketing purposes. I haven't made a page from scratch since the creation of responsive web design, so I needed to spend time understanding the material. Unfortunately that doesn't always give you code worth posting and I wanted to work on my own site with everything created by me down to the pixel. I still plan to do this, but I learned that this method doesn't give you much code to post daily and I didn't want to spend hours creating updates or notes to lose them. 

My solution:
I streamlined my accounts and added WakaTime to keep track of my time coding and making notes for #100DaysofCode. I will also use WakaTime to keep track of my sessions on code learning sites, but I'm not counting every YouTube tutorial and side project learning curve. Those will only count as VSCode time if I type the code myself.

I added Toggl Time Tracking to track any additional time, and created a schedule in blocks that can be rearranged regardless of external timetables. To maintain balance, the schedule also batches some tasks, has a meal plan, and a fitness/health plan. To allow me to easily post updates, I decided to put up a WordPress site (due to the familiarity) that will allow me to post any updates or projects, leaving my code on Github and CodePen. I will release that site on January 1, 2022 and I'm taking this month to start in advance and prepare for a busy year. I've been following the schedule for a week, but as of today I am comfortable saying this is not only sustainable, but a much better way of doing this challenge in my circumstances.

I set more realistic deadlines, did some research on what topics should be covered to bridge some of the knowledge issues, and got tips from so many people who have been there or had valuable insights.

Despite my best efforts, today was nothing short of a disaster. Although I am frustrated, the disruption should have limited my productivity, but it didn't. My changes held up and I feel comfortable saying that today was likely a badly timed exception to the rule. I had a medical emergency, surprise client phone call for assistance that took hours, and an impromptu school meeting. With the changes in place I did an hour of JavaScript lessons on FreeCodeCamp and even watched an episode of television. I think this problem is resolved.

Most code will be in this Github Account, but select items are on Codepen. (I sometimes use this to work on small blocks while on the go.)

To socialize and hold myself accountable, I am active on Tech Twitter and my WakaTime will post at midnight EST every night.
