### R1D1 
April 15, 2022

I spent the last year making changes to everything in order to focus more time on coding. I tried #100DaysofCode a few times, but couldn't complete it due to work obligations. Now things have finally slowed down enough that I am able to code daily, plus I will be back in school in the fall which will allow me more time to code. 
Today I'm mostly getting organized, but my hour of code will be using the ZTM Dev course to refresh and ease my way back into coding all the time. My schedule only lists Sections 1-5, but I'm hoping to get a bit farther along to start working on the first project. I'll update this at the end of the day, but I'm going to start filling up my Github with projects for a change.
