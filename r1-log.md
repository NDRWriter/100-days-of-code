April 15, 2022

I spent the last year making changes to everything in order to focus more time on coding. I tried #100DaysofCode a few times, but couldn't complete it due to work obligations. Now things have finally slowed down enough that I am able to code daily, plus I will be back in school in the fall which will allow me more time to code. 
Today I'm mostly getting organized, but my hour of code will be using the ZTM Dev course to refresh and ease my way back into coding all the time. My schedule only lists Sections 1-5, but I'm hoping to get a bit farther along to start working on the first project. I'll update this at the end of the day, but I'm going to start filling up my Github with projects for a change. 

PM Update: Determined to actually complete every course I've purchased, I started with the beginning ZTM Dev course and completed the HTML sections (1-5). I also worked on my personal site (returning to it after this message) and updated all of my coding sites, contacts, and repository locations. All in all it was closer to 5 hours of code related time, 2.5 recorded on my WakaTime, and I turned tracking off for the remainder because they were related to work and not my personal coding time. 

ZTM covered HTML for these sections and I was familiar with all of it, so I won't comment about it much. I'm sure it would have been helpful when I first learned HTML, but I'm curious to see if the later content will redirect to W3 as often as the first sections did. W3 is a great reference, but I'm looking into supplemental material for the content that is new to me as I don't like to skim over details.

I continued working on the HTML for the website layout. I coded for over 2 hours and it's mostly been coding the layout and making design choices for the html/css. I've been copying some of the parts of a previous website design that I used in wordpress and building it myself.

Today was a holiday, so I got a later start than usual. I did manage to code for 1 hour and 31 minutes, but my WakaTime didn't pick it up for some reason. Fortunately Click Up worked as my backup. I did a quick HTML refresher on W3, worked on the code for a news ticker, added some code for featured images/articles, and added a section to my site.

Today was the work holiday, so I took some time off with my family and I will make tomorrow my day four entry.

R1D4- Update
April 19, 2022 (Tuesday)

Forgetting that my WakaTime needs adjustments, I didn't capture all of my time, but I did get well over one hour of coding in. I stopped counting after an hour with HTML and CSS, but I also put some time in brushing up on current trends. That included looking into the impact of some of these changes on loading speeds. THe features look great, but it reminds me of similar changes like pointers and minor animations that became popular in the 90's but bogged everything down and became more of a distraction. I did find a subtle paralax scroll effect/ design that I'd like to create at some point. I am adding it to my list of projects for the future, but it will take some time to build all of the features in and do the custom art/ filter work blend out some of the image edge. I feel like this was one of the most elegant predictions made by DesignCourse on YouTube, but the 2022 prediction video actually shows several examples that I found elsewhere in one source. I really wanted to see someone building somethign that melted my brain, but sites are getting more standardized which helps with quality control and consistency. On the other hand, it starts to get a bit repetitive, like cookie cutter homes in modern subdivisions.

I had a lot of work today, so instead of coding tonight- I'm going to have to make up a second night. I'm still looking up CSS trends and coming up with a concept I want to build. I'm also working on setting up my WordPress site so I have a place to quick post my progress. I'm also going to set a deadline for publishing the site and a consistent posting schedule for after launch. I don't expect a big amount of traffic, but I'm going to use it to upgrade my WordPress Skills as I build sites from HTML-CSS-JS. 

Tonight I'm also researching the current meta tags that should be used for SEO, functionality, etc. for 2022. I want to check out the data for recommendations on the current Google Algorithm and create a list of keywords. I'm not counting it toward coding, but I need to take care of this quickly in order to get the site up and running soon.
